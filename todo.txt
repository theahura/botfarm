Git autocreate commit message
Git comments
git handle merges that already happened
git handle deletes of worktrees that already happened and vice versa for branches (gracefully)

If you try and merge multiple in a row it fails (maybe because of merge conflicts)

Because each sub-version is running in its own git worktree, need to figure out how to properly test builds between them
